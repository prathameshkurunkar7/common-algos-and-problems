# List Reversal in Python

### Steps:

Given a list, print it in the reverse order

[::1]
Start at the beginning, end when it ends, walk in steps of 1. 
[::- 1] 
Start at the end (the minus does that for you), end when nothing's left and walk backwards by 1. 
1.	Define a function rev that takes a list (l) as a parameter
2.	 return l[::-1]
3.	Take the list as input and pass it to the function.
