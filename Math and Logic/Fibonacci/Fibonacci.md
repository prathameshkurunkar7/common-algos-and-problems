# Fibonacci

The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers:

_0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ..._

The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it:

_Example_

the 2 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+1),
the 3 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+2),
the 5 is (2+3),
and so on!

When using Dynamic/Iterative Approach:
_Time Complexity:O(n)_ 
_Extra Space: O(1)_
