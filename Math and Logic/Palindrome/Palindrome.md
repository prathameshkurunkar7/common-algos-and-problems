# Palindrome

A word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backwards as forwards is a palindrome, e.g. madam, 1221.

### Steps

1. Accept a number
2. Reverse the number (for more details check out [How to Reverse a number](https://github.com/prathameshkurunkar7/common-algos-and-problems/blob/main/Math%20and%20Logic/Reverse%20Number/ReverseNumber.md))
3. Check if the entered number and the reversed number are the same
4. If they are, then the entered number is a palindrome, else it isn't
