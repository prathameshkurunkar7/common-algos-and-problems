# Common Algorithms and Problems

This repository aims to collect solutions for frequently asked problems in DSA.

If you have solutions for any such problems, feel free to add it into this repository. Preferred Implementations would be in languages like: _C++, Java, Python_ .

You can add solutions in other language if one is already existing in repo.
Make sure you add .py files in case of Python and not Jupyter Notebook solutions.

#### General Instructions:

1. Keep your code neat and understandable. Add comments wherever needed.
2. Add a ReadMe file for each solution. Look into the template attached if any doubts, edit the same.
3. Maintain File Structure.
