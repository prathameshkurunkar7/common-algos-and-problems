#  Linear Search

A linear search or sequential search is a method for finding an element within a list. It sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or the whole list has been searched.

In linear search,
Start from the leftmost element of arr[] and one by one compare x with each element of arr[]
If x matches with an element, return the index or a flag.
If x doesnâ€™t match with any of elements, return -1.

Linear search is rarely used practically because other search algorithms such as the binary search algorithm and hash tables allow significantly faster-searching comparison to Linear search.
