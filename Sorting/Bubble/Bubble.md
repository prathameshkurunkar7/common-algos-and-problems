#  Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.
In bubble sort, we start at the beginning of the array and swap the first two elements if first is greater than the second. Then we go to the next pair, and so on, continuously making sweeps of the array until it is sorted. In doing so, the smaller items slowly "bubble" upto the beginning of the list.

_Time Complexity(Avg and Worst): O(n^2)_
_Best Case Time Complexity: O(n). Best case occurs when array is already sorted._
_Space complexity: O(1)_
_Sorting In Place: Yes_
_Stable: Yes_
